## Global Missing Migrants

The phenomenon of global missing migrants stands as a critical issue at the intersection of human rights, migration, and international policy. This complex and distressing reality refers to individuals who, during their migration journeys, have disappeared, with their fate often remaining unknown. These missing migrants encompass a diverse range of people â€“ refugees, asylum seekers, economic migrants, or individuals escaping conflict, persecution, poverty, or environmental crises.

The Global Missing Migrants dataset used here represents a comprehensive repository of information detailing the cases and circumstances surrounding missing migrants worldwide.This dataset is the result of the Missing Migrants Project,
an initiative by the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The dataset encompasses diverse variables,demographic information, migration routes, years, locations, and potential causes or circumstances of disappearance or loss.Hence it serves as a crucial tool for conducting in-depth analyses, identifying trends, and uncovering insights into the challenges and risks faced by migrants,during their journeys across borders, seas, or terrains. Researchers and policymakers can leverage this dataset to develop evidence-based strategies aimed at enhancing migrant safety, improving migration policies, and addressing the underlying causes leading to these disappearances.

By harnessing the power of data-driven insights, stakeholders can work towards implementing more effective solutions and support systems to mitigate the risks faced by migrants and reduce the incidence of missing migrant cases worldwide.
